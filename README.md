  The source code of a test project for a static website, in development.

  My goal was to make a static website using HTML, CSS, Java Script and BootStrap.
  <br>
  I have deployed my project on vercel.

  The link to the deployed site is <a href="https://cookbook-aict-semproject.vercel.app/" style="padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #007bff; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;">
